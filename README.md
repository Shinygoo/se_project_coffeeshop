## Plans on improving the project

Here are future enhancement I'd like to implement:

### 1. **Visual enhancements**

-Source higher-quality, thematic background images (e.g., coffee beans, bookshelves)

-Include real photos.

### 2. **Dynamic content**

-Add a customer review section form or a mock coffee customization tool (e.g. "Design your drink")

**_Recomendations or tips are always welcomed._**
